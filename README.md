A basic python-flask web application that allows a user to nominate another team user for an award by:
1) Enter the website - https://the-nominator.herokuapp.com/
2) Login (no authentication but logic to ensure something is entered)
3) Nominate - Your username, Your e-mail address, Your nomination (drop-down menu) and Reason for nominating the person.
4) Input gets e-mailed to the admin
5) Results get calculated
6) The winner is displayed with the number of votes they received out of the total votes
